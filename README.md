# BeholderTech

A magitech mod without adding unecessary worldgen.

## Item Based Energy

This mod starts with the creation of \[Power Crystals\], which are then charged and then consumed to power various machines.

## Mineral Duplication/Multiplication

Minerals are first reduced to a Dust (some already handily come in this form), then Dusts are crystallized into one or more Shards,
  which are then put through various methods to return them to their Mineral form (Cut for gems, crystallized for Quartz, crushed for Dusts)
